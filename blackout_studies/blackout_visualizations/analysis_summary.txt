   Total blackout duration: 20.0 hours

BEST PERFORMING:
   Winter Storm Elliott (December 2022)
   Reliability: 42.2%
   Blackout events: 8

WORST PERFORMING:
   Texas Winter Storm Uri (February 2021)
   Reliability: 37.9%
   Blackout events: 20

WEATHER IMPACT ANALYSIS:
   Cold weather avg reliability: 40.0%
   Heat weather avg reliability: 40.8%
   Cold weather is -0.8% less reliable

KEY INSIGHTS:
   * All scenarios experienced frequency deviations > 1 Hz
   * Texas winter event was most severe (87% generation loss)
   * Cold weather scenarios show worse performance than heat
   * Renewable penetration increased during blackouts
   * Agent coordination breaks down after multiple failures

RECOMMENDATIONS:
   * Implement comprehensive equipment winterization
   * Deploy automatic emergency frequency response
   * Increase battery storage capacity by 40%
   * Enhance demand response programs
   * Improve agent communication protocols
