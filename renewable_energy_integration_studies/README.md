## Research Foundation

Based on the comprehensive analysis of renewable energy integration challenges from academic literature, this framework tests your smart grid system against:

### 1. **Intermittency & Variability Challenges**
- **Solar Intermittency**: Rapid output changes due to cloud cover
- **Wind Variability**: Extreme ramping events and forecast uncertainties
- **Stochastic Behavior**: Unpredictable renewable generation patterns

### 2. **Power Quality Issues**
- **Voltage Fluctuations**: System response to variable renewable output
- **Frequency Regulation**: Grid stability under reduced inertia
- **Harmonic Distortion**: Power quality maintenance with inverter-based generation

### 3. **Deep Penetration Scenarios**
- **High Renewable Penetration**: Testing >80% renewable scenarios
- **Duck Curve Challenges**: Evening ramping requirements
- **Grid Inertia Reduction**: System stability with conventional generator displacement

### 4. **Storage Integration Complexities**
- **Arbitrage Optimization**: Storage coordination under price volatility
- **Degradation Management**: Realistic cycling cost considerations
- **Multiple Storage Coordination**: Preventing conflicting strategies

### 5. **Market Mechanism Stress**
- **Price Volatility**: Market efficiency under renewable variability
- **Forecasting Errors**: System response to prediction failures
- **Emergency Procedures**: Blackout prevention and recovery

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Interactive Menu
```bash
cd renewable_energy_integration_studies
python run_stress_tests.py
