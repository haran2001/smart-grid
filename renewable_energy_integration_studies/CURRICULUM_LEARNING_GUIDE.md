# Curriculum Learning for Renewable Energy Integration

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Statement**

Your current renewable energy integration studies show **catastrophic failures**:
- **0% renewable energy penetration** across all tests
- **Complete renewable resource dispatch failure**
- **Critical grid instability** (frequency violations, voltage issues)
- **$367/MWh system costs** indicating market dysfunction
- **Agents unresponsive to weather data**

These failures occur because agents are **overwhelmed by complexity** from the start - trying to learn renewable integration, weather responsiveness, and grid stability simultaneously.

## ðŸ“š **Curriculum Learning Solution**

Based on "The AI Economist" paper methodology, we implement **two-phase curriculum training**:

### **Phase 1: Foundation Training (50K steps)**
```python
# Stable traditional grid training
stable_config = {
    "renewable_capacity_factor": 0.0,    # No renewables initially
    "weather_variability": 0.1,          # Minimal weather variation
    "demand_patterns": "stable",         # Predictable demand
    "market_volatility": 0.2            # Low market volatility
}
```

**Purpose**: Agents master basic grid operations, market bidding, and coordination before encountering renewable complexity.

### **Phase 2: Gradual Complexity Introduction (200K steps)**
```python
# Annealing schedule over 50K steps
annealing_progress = step / 50_000
renewable_capacity = 0.0 + progress * 0.8      # 0% â†’ 80% renewables
weather_variability = 0.1 + progress * 0.9     # Low â†’ High variation
demand_variability = 0.2 + progress * 0.6      # Stable â†’ Variable

# Progressive challenge activation
enable_intermittency = progress > 0.3   # 30% through annealing
enable_ramping = progress > 0.5        # 50% through annealing  
enable_duck_curve = progress > 0.7     # 70% through annealing
```

## ðŸ”§ **Implementation Details**

### **Key Files Created**
1. **`curriculum_integration.py`** - Main curriculum trainer
2. **`run_curriculum_training.py`** - Easy-to-run script
3. **`CURRICULUM_LEARNING_GUIDE.md`** - This documentation

### **Curriculum Schedules**

#### **Renewable Penetration Annealing**
```
Step 0:     0% renewable capacity
Step 25K:   40% renewable capacity  
Step 50K:   80% renewable capacity (full)
```

#### **Weather Variability Annealing**
```
Step 0:     Ïƒ_weather = 0.1 (minimal variation)
Step 25K:   Ïƒ_weather = 0.55 (moderate variation)
Step 50K:   Ïƒ_weather = 1.0 (full weather dynamics)
```

#### **Challenge Activation Schedule**
```
Step 0-15K:   Basic renewable generation only
Step 15K-25K: + Solar/wind intermittency
Step 25K-35K: + Ramping events
Step 35K-50K: + Duck curve challenges
```

### **Performance Monitoring**

The system tracks three key metrics during training:

```python
# Renewable utilization score (0-1)
renewable_score = min(1.0, renewable_generation / total_generation * 1.25)

# Grid stability score (0-1) 
freq_score = max(0.0, 1.0 - abs(frequency - 50.0) / 0.5)
volt_score = max(0.0, 1.0 - abs(voltage - 1.0) / 0.2)
stability_score = (freq_score + volt_score) / 2.0

# Economic efficiency score (0-1)
economic_score = max(0.0, 1.0 - (cost - target_cost) / target_cost)
```

## ðŸš€ **How to Run**

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# From smart-grid root directory
