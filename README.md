## 🧠 Curriculum Learning Framework for Renewable Integration

### **The Challenge: Catastrophic Renewable Integration Failures**

Current stress testing reveals **critical system failures** when integrating renewable energy:

```
📊 CURRENT RENEWABLE INTEGRATION PERFORMANCE (Complete System Breakdown)
┌─────────────────────┬────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Test Scenario       │ System Cost    │ Renewable Usage  │ Grid Stability  │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Solar Intermittency │ $49,722        │ 0% (FAILURE)     │ 49.87 Hz        │
│ Wind Ramping        │ $38,000        │ 0% (FAILURE)     │ 50.51 Hz        │
│ Duck Curve          │ $64,247        │ 0% (FAILURE)     │ 49.81 Hz        │
└─────────────────────┴────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────┘

🚨 CRITICAL FAILURES:
• 0% renewable energy penetration across all scenarios
• $367/MWh pricing dysfunction during duck curve stress
• Storage systems charging during peak demand (counterproductive)
• Complete renewable dispatch failure
• Critical frequency violations (49.81-50.51 Hz vs. target 50.0 ± 0.1 Hz)
```

**Root Cause**: Agents are **overwhelmed by complexity** - trying to learn renewable integration, weather responsiveness, grid stability, and market dynamics simultaneously from scratch.

### **🎓 Curriculum Learning Solution**

Inspired by "The AI Economist" paper methodology, we implement **progressive complexity training** to transform agents from complete renewable integration failure to 50-70% renewable penetration success.

#### **Two-Phase Training Architecture**

**Phase 1: Foundation Training** (`50M steps`)
- **Environment**: Traditional grid without renewables
- **Objective**: Master basic grid operations:
  - Market bidding strategies
  - Supply-demand balance  
  - Frequency regulation
  - Economic dispatch fundamentals

**Phase 2: Progressive Renewable Integration** (`400M steps`)
- **Environment**: Gradually increasing renewable complexity
- **Curriculum Annealing**: Progressive introduction over 54M steps

```python
# Annealing schedule transforming simple → complex scenarios
for step in range(400_000_000):
    if step < 54_000_000:
        # Progressive complexity increase
        weather_variability = 0.1 + (step / 54_000_000) * 0.9
        renewable_penetration = 0.05 + (step / 54_000_000) * 0.65
        duck_curve_intensity = (step / 54_000_000) * 0.8
    else:
        # Full complexity training
        weather_variability = 1.0    # Full weather chaos
        renewable_penetration = 0.7   # 70% renewable target
        duck_curve_intensity = 0.8    # Full duck curve challenge
```

#### **Key Curriculum Dimensions**

1. **🌤️ Weather Variability Annealing**
   ```python
   # Week 1-2: Predictable (10% variability) → Week 8+: Chaotic (100% variability)
   solar_output = base_solar * (1.0 + weather_variability * random_factor)
   wind_output = base_wind * (1.0 + weather_variability * wind_variation)
   ```

2. **⚡ Renewable Penetration Scaling**
   ```python
   # Gradual capacity introduction: 5% → 70% renewable penetration
   renewable_fraction = 0.05 + curriculum_progress * 0.65
   ```

3. **📈 Market Complexity Progression**
   ```python
   # Simple uniform pricing → Complex real-time market dynamics
   # Perfect forecasts → Uncertain weather/demand predictions
   ```

4. **🦆 Duck Curve Challenge Introduction**
   ```python
   # No evening ramps → Full duck curve intensity (±50MW swings)
   duck_curve_factor = curriculum_progress * 0.8
   ```

### **🚀 Implementation & Usage**

#### **Quick Start: Run Curriculum Training**
```bash
# Navigate to curriculum learning directory
cd curriculum_learning/

# Run demo curriculum training (5 minutes)
python run_curriculum.py --mode demo

# Run full curriculum training (research-grade, 450M steps)
python run_curriculum.py --mode full

# Debug mode with detailed logging
python run_curriculum.py --mode debug
```

#### **Integration with Existing Studies**
```python
# Before curriculum training: Catastrophic failures
results_baseline = run_stress_test("duck_curve")  
# Result: 0% renewable usage, $64,247 cost, critical instability

# After curriculum training: Transformed performance
curriculum_trained_agents = load_curriculum_agents()
results_enhanced = run_stress_test("duck_curve", agents=curriculum_trained_agents)
# Expected: 50-70% renewable usage, 30-50% cost reduction, stable operation
```

### **📊 Expected Performance Transformation**

| **Metric** | **Baseline (Untrained)** | **Curriculum-Trained** | **Improvement** |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Renewable Integration** | 0% (complete failure) | 50-70% penetration | **∞% improvement** |
| **Duck Curve Handling** | $64,247 dysfunction | $40,000 efficient | **37% cost reduction** |

## 💰 Smart Grid Auction System

### **How the Auction Works**
The system operates a **uniform price auction** every 5 minutes where all participants bid, and winners receive the same clearing price determined by the marginal (last accepted) unit.

### **Auction Process Overview**
1. **Bid Collection**: Agents submit price/quantity bids to Grid Operator
2. **Merit Order**: Bids sorted by price (cheapest supply first)
3. **Market Clearing**: Supply-demand intersection determines clearing price
4. **Dispatch**: Winners execute at uniform clearing price
5. **Settlement**: Payments processed and performance tracked

## 📊 Detailed Auction Example

### **Market Setup**
- **Current Demand**: 120 MW needed
- **Time**: 14:30 (peak afternoon period)
- **Grid Status**: 50.0 Hz, stable voltage

### **Step 1: Agent Bids Submitted**

#### **🏭 Generation Supply Bids**
```python
generation_bids = [
    ("solar_farm_1", $25/MWh, 30 MW),    # Renewable - lowest cost
    ("wind_farm_1", $30/MWh, 25 MW),     # Renewable - low cost
    ("coal_plant_1", $45/MWh, 50 MW),    # Traditional baseload
    ("gas_plant_1", $65/MWh, 40 MW),     # Peaking plant
    ("gas_plant_2", $75/MWh, 35 MW),     # Expensive peaker
]
```

#### **🔋 Storage System Bids**
```python
storage_bids = [
    ("battery_1", "discharge", $55/MWh, 15 MW),  # Energy arbitrage
    ("battery_2", "charge", $40/MWh, 10 MW),     # Willing to charge
]
```

#### **🏠 Consumer Demand Response**
```python
demand_response_offers = [
    ("factory_1", $80/MWh, 8 MW),    # Industrial load reduction
    ("mall_1", $90/MWh, 5 MW),       # Commercial load shifting
]
```

### **Step 2: Supply Curve Construction**

#### **Merit Order (Price Sorted)**
```python
# Grid Operator sorts all supply by price
supply_curve = [
    ($25/MWh, 30 MW, "solar_farm_1"),     # Cumulative: 0-30 MW
    ($30/MWh, 25 MW, "wind_farm_1"),      # Cumulative: 30-55 MW
    ($45/MWh, 50 MW, "coal_plant_1"),     # Cumulative: 55-105 MW
    ($55/MWh, 15 MW, "battery_1"),        # Cumulative: 105-120 MW ← Marginal unit
    ($65/MWh, 40 MW, "gas_plant_1"),      # Cumulative: 120-160 MW (not needed)
    ($75/MWh, 35 MW, "gas_plant_2"),      # Cumulative: 160-195 MW (not needed)
]
```

### **Step 3: Market Clearing Results**

#### **Clearing Calculation**
- **Target Demand**: 120 MW
- **Marginal Unit**: Battery at $55/MWh (last unit needed)
- **Clearing Price**: $55/MWh (uniform price for all)
- **Total System Cost**: $55/MWh × 120 MW = $6,600/hour

#### **Cleared Generation Dispatch**
```python
cleared_bids = [
    ("solar_farm_1", 30 MW, $55/MWh),    # Revenue: $1,650/hour
    ("wind_farm_1", 25 MW, $55/MWh),     # Revenue: $1,375/hour
    ("coal_plant_1", 50 MW, $55/MWh),    # Revenue: $2,750/hour
    ("battery_1", 15 MW, $55/MWh),       # Revenue: $825/hour
]
# Total: 120 MW exactly matches demand
```

### **Step 4: Dispatch Instructions**

#### **✅ Winners (Cleared Agents)**
Each cleared agent receives identical dispatch instruction:
```python
dispatch_message = {
    "message_type": "DISPATCH_INSTRUCTION",
    "cleared_quantity_mw": [agent_specific],
    "clearing_price_mwh": 55.0,        # Same for all!
    "grid_conditions": {
        "frequency_hz": 50.0,
        "voltage_pu": 1.0,
        "renewable_penetration": 55/120 = 45.8%
    }
}
```

#### **❌ Losers (Not Cleared)**
Non-cleared agents receive market update:
```python
market_update = {
    "message_type": "MARKET_PRICE_UPDATE", 
    "clearing_price_mwh": 55.0,
    "status": "bid_not_cleared",
    "reason": "demand_met_by_cheaper_generation"
}
```

## 💡 Economic Analysis

### **Agent Profit/Loss Analysis**

#### **Generator Profits (Bid vs. Clearing Price)**
```python
# All generators paid clearing price ($55), regardless of bid price
solar_profit = ($55 - $25) × 30 MW = $900/hour  # 120% markup!
wind_profit = ($55 - $30) × 25 MW = $625/hour   # 83% markup!
coal_profit = ($55 - $45) × 50 MW = $500/hour   # 22% markup!
battery_profit = ($55 - $55) × 15 MW = $0/hour  # Marginal unit (no profit)

# Not cleared (no revenue):
gas_plant_1_profit = $0/hour  # Bid too high ($65)
gas_plant_2_profit = $0/hour  # Bid too high ($75)
```

#### **Key Economic Principles**
1. **Marginal Pricing**: Price set by most expensive cleared unit
2. **Inframarginal Rent**: Cheaper units earn profit above their costs
3. **Economic Efficiency**: Lowest-cost generation dispatched first
4. **Environmental Benefit**: Renewables always clear (lowest bids)

## 🎯 Strategic Implications

### **🏭 Generator Bidding Strategies**
- **Can't bid too low**: Lose potential profit if clearing price is higher
- **Can't bid too high**: Risk not being cleared at all
- **Sweet spot**: Bid slightly below expected clearing price
- **Market power**: If often marginal, you influence the clearing price

#### **Learning Patterns**
```python
# Generator RL agents learn:
if historical_clearing_price > my_bid:
    # I left money on the table
    next_bid = increase_bid_slightly()
    
if my_bid_not_cleared:
    # I was too expensive
    next_bid = decrease_bid_to_compete()
```

### **🔋 Storage Arbitrage Strategy**
- **Charge when**: Market price < $40/MWh (cheap periods)
- **Discharge when**: Market price > $55/MWh (expensive periods) 
- **Hold when**: Price between $40-55/MWh (wait for better opportunity)
- **Grid services**: Additional revenue from frequency regulation

### **🏠 Consumer Response Strategy**
- **Peak shaving**: Reduce load when clearing price > $80/MWh
- **Load shifting**: Move flexible loads to sub-$40/MWh periods
- **Comfort trade-off**: Balance cost savings vs. convenience loss

## 📈 Alternative Market Scenarios

### **High Demand Scenario (150 MW)**
```python
# Additional generation would clear:
cleared_bids = [
    ("solar_farm_1", 30 MW, $65/MWh),    # Higher clearing price
    ("wind_farm_1", 25 MW, $65/MWh),
    ("coal_plant_1", 50 MW, $65/MWh), 
    ("battery_1", 15 MW, $65/MWh),
    ("gas_plant_1", 30 MW, $65/MWh),     # Now profitable!
]
# New clearing price: $65/MWh (gas plant sets margin)
# System cost: $65 × 150 MW = $9,750/hour (+47% cost increase)
```

### **Low Demand Scenario (80 MW)**
```python
# Less generation needed:
cleared_bids = [
    ("solar_farm_1", 30 MW, $45/MWh),    # Lower clearing price
    ("wind_farm_1", 25 MW, $45/MWh),
    ("coal_plant_1", 25 MW, $45/MWh),    # Partial dispatch
]
# New clearing price: $45/MWh (coal plant sets margin)
# System cost: $45 × 80 MW = $3,600/hour (-45% cost decrease)
```

### 🎯 **The Challenge: Catastrophic Renewable Integration Failures**

Current stress testing reveals **critical system failures** when integrating renewable energy:

```
📊 CURRENT RENEWABLE INTEGRATION PERFORMANCE
┌─────────────────────┬────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Test Scenario       │ System Cost    │ Renewable Usage  │ Grid Stability  │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Solar Intermittency │ $49,722        │ 0% (FAILURE)     │ 49.87 Hz        │
│ Wind Ramping        │ $38,000        │ 0% (FAILURE)     │ 50.51 Hz        │
│ Duck Curve          │ $64,247        │ 0% (FAILURE)     │ 49.81 Hz        │
└─────────────────────┴────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────┘

🚨 CRITICAL FAILURES:
• 0% renewable energy penetration across all scenarios
• $367/MWh pricing dysfunction during duck curve stress
• Storage systems charging during peak demand (counterproductive)
• Complete renewable dispatch failure
• Critical frequency violations (49.81-50.51 Hz vs. target 50.0 ± 0.1 Hz)
```

**Root Cause**: Agents are **overwhelmed by complexity** - trying to learn renewable integration, weather responsiveness, grid stability, and market dynamics simultaneously from scratch.

### 🧠 **Curriculum Learning Solution**

Inspired by "The AI Economist" paper methodology, we implement **two-phase curriculum training** to gradually introduce renewable energy complexity, enabling robust policy convergence.

#### **Phase 1: Foundation Training (Stable Grid)**
- **Duration**: 50M training steps
- **Environment**: Traditional grid without renewables
- **Objective**: Agents master basic behaviors:
  - Market bidding strategies
  - Supply-demand balance
  - Frequency regulation
  - Economic dispatch fundamentals
- **Result**: Well-adapted agents for general grid operations

#### **Phase 2: Progressive Renewable Integration**
- **Duration**: 400M training steps  
- **Environment**: Gradually increasing renewable complexity
- **Curriculum Schedule**:
  ```python
  # Annealing schedule over 54M steps
  for step in range(400_000_000):
      if step < 54_000_000:
          # Progressive complexity increase
          renewable_variability = 0.1 + (step / 54_000_000) * 0.9
          weather_stress_factor = renewable_variability
      else:
          # Full complexity training
          renewable_variability = 1.0
          weather_stress_factor = 1.0
  ```

#### **Key Curriculum Dimensions**

1. **🌤️ Weather Variability Annealing**
   ```python
   # Week 1-2: Predictable weather (variability = 10%)
   solar_output = base_solar * (0.9 + 0.1 * smooth_variation)
   
   # Week 3-8: Gradual increase (variability = 10% → 100%)  
   solar_output = base_solar * (0.5 + 0.5 * increasing_variation)
   
   # Week 9+: Full weather chaos (variability = 100%)
   solar_output = base_solar * real_weather_patterns
   ```

2. **⚡ Intermittency Challenge Progression**
   ```python
   challenge_schedule = [
       (0, "stable_generation"),      # Weeks 1-2
       (0.25, "mild_intermittency"),  # Weeks 3-4  
       (0.5, "moderate_ramps"),       # Weeks 5-6
       (0.75, "severe_variability"),  # Weeks 7-8
       (1.0, "extreme_duck_curve")    # Weeks 9+
   ]
   ```

3. **📈 Renewable Penetration Scaling**
   ```python
   # Gradual renewable capacity introduction
   renewable_fraction = min(0.7, 0.1 + (training_week / 8) * 0.6)
   
   # Week 1: 10% renewables, Week 8: 70% renewables
   ```

4. **🔄 Market Complexity Annealing**
   ```python
   # Simple uniform pricing → Complex nodal pricing
   # Fixed demand → Dynamic demand response
   # Perfect forecasts → Uncertain forecasts
   ```

### 🚀 **Implementation Architecture**

#### **Curriculum Training Module** (`src/agents/curriculum_training.py`)
```python
class CurriculumTrainer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.phase1_steps = 50_000_000  # Foundation training
        self.phase2_steps = 400_000_000 # Curriculum training
        self.annealing_steps = 54_000_000  # Complexity ramp-up
        
    async def train_with_curriculum(self, agents):
        # Phase 1: Stable grid mastery
        await self.phase1_foundation_training(agents)
        
        # Phase 2: Progressive renewable integration
        await self.phase2_curriculum_training(agents)
```

#### **Renewable Curriculum Integration** (`renewable_energy_integration_studies/curriculum_integration.py`)
```python
class CurriculumRenewableTrainer:
    def apply_curriculum_schedule(self, step: int) -> Dict[str, float]:
        # Calculate curriculum parameters for current step
        progress = min(1.0, step / self.annealing_steps)
        
        return {
            "weather_variability": 0.1 + 0.9 * progress,
            "renewable_penetration": 0.1 + 0.6 * progress,
            "market_complexity": 0.3 + 0.7 * progress,
