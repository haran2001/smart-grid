# On Multiagent Reinforcement Learning to Simulate Smart Electric Grids and Optimize Renewable energy Production 

![Electic Grids are the pillars of modern technology](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*valorant-image.jpeg)

## Introduction
Power cuts are frequent in India
Global warming is a problem 
Lots of CO2 released every day 
Need effective integration of renewables into our grid 
Use an auction system to optimize efficiency and provide value to consumer
calibrated every 5 mins

Think of a situation and construct an architecture using the give set of agents
Construct any architure you want using the agents provided to you 
This will let you simulate any situation you want
for example:
Optimum amount of renewable energy resources in a grid: Too little would mean pollution, too many would may not be reliable enough. Is it possible to find the sweet spot?
Blackout: Undersatand how robust the system is 
Market analysis: Undersatnd if the autonomous agents can provide economic value to the producer and consumer of electricity

Convert a centralised system to decentralized using multi-agent RL
How will a decentralized system function under pressures of a natural disaster
Need to add circuit breakers to present blackouts

## Overall Architecture:

* Grid Operator Agent:
Manages all the intermediate agents
Magages the market and clear in the aution
Can use different auction starategies to manage the aution (continous bid  etc..)
Can manage in different interval frequencies

* Producers Agents:
Types of producer agents
These are the agents in the system that produce electric power
Uses xyz RL method to learn on synthetic data
This is the reason xyz policy is the best for a producer of electric energy
These are the parameters used that will enables the agent to mimc a producer unit

* Consumers Agents:
Types of consumer agents
The are the agents in the system that consume electric power
Uses xyz RL method to learn on synthetic data, add the equation that briefly explains this method
This is the reason xyz policy is selected for a consumer of electric energy
These are the parameters used that will enables the agent to mimc a consumers unit

* Storage Agents:
Uses xyz RL method to learn on synthetic data
This is the reason xyz policy is the best for a storage of electric energy
These are the parameters used that will enables the agent to mimc a storage unit

## Working:
How the producers, consumers, storage and grid agents interact with eachother. Explain a brief example about what happens and how the agents communicate with eachother to make decisions and where the impact of those decisions are felt.

## Principle:
How does recovery take place in a system like this?
We try to see if a system of agents competing against each other can create a robust (protection against disasters) and cost-efficient power grid?
How to prove this?
1. Compare how the real world grid responded
2. Compare the cost efficiency with the costs of the real world power grid
This can be a challenge as the data was trained on 

## Hypothesis
Using the smart-grid simulator to solve model existing problems in electrical grids by running experiments to examine the following hypothesis:
1. This system will behave more efficiently that conventional grids
2. Blackouts can be simulated and minigated by understanding their core factors/reasons the occur

## Results:
See how true the hypothesis turned out to be based on the blackout studies and market studies.
what are the conclusions from the experiment that can be implemented in the real world

## Drawbacks:
missing generator physics informatin like intertia nad stuff
more focus on the economical benifits

## Improvements:
1. Predictive maintainence
2. How to simulate cybersecurity vulnerabilities?

## Experiment Ideas:
1. How does the calibration period affect the final price paid by consumer?
2. Does smaller calibration time mean better optimization -> better prices?
3. Does the use of AI make the power grid market more efficient?
4. What do blackout simulations tell us about real world electric grids?
