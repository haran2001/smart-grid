PROMPT 1:
Explain this implementation in detail (in words not code) and which of the above concepts will be used in it.

Smart Grid Energy Management
Concept: Agents representing power generators, storage systems, and consumers Real Value:
* Balance supply and demand in real-time
* Integrate renewable energy sources effectively
* Reduce peak loads and optimize pricing
* Test grid stability under various scenarios
Technical Approach: Agents use RL to learn optimal bidding strategies while maintaining grid stability

What will be the architecture of the agents?
Will the agents communicate with each other using A2A?
What will be the out come of this solution?  Can that outcome be commoditized as a business or a startup?


PROMPT 2:
Give a technical document that explains: 
The exact metrics that will be used
The framework that the agents involved will use to make decisions and reflect their agent behavior
What are the tools that will be available to each agent
An example communication cycle between the agents 
How can the decision making process of the agents be visualized
How can the outputs of the simulation be visualized to the stake holders based on which they can make meaningful decisions 
What aspects of this this example communication will be useful to real life stakeholders
What are existing methods to do this smart grid management and how we can outperform them
Limitations/drawbacks of this simulation
